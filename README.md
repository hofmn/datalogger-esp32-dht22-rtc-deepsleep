DataLogger
This project aims to create a data logger using an ESP32 microcontroller and an SCD22 sensor to log humidity and temperature measurements. The data logger will operate independently of the power grid by utilizing a battery module and an SD card module for data storage. To ensure accurate time measurements while the chip is in deep sleep mode, an RTC (Real-Time Clock) will be incorporated into the project.
